"""Refuse to mutate governance under an AWS SDK that cannot see the fields.

The defect this prevents
-----------------------

botocore parses and serializes strictly against its bundled service model, and it drops
fields it does not know **in both directions, silently**. Measured on a workshop box:

    botocore 1.43.28   UpdatePolicy input: definition, description, policyEngineId,
                       policyId, validationMode
    botocore 1.43.51   ... the same, plus enforcementMode

Under 1.43.28, `scripts/policy_mode.py --restore-shipped` would send `update_policy` with
no `enforcementMode` at all. The service applies its own default, the API returns 200, the
diff shows nothing, and Cedar enforcement is off for the rest of the workshop. Every DENY
the labs teach becomes a line in a log.

That is why this is a hard stop and not a warning, and why it checks the SERVICE MODEL
rather than a version string: a version comparison encodes today's cut line, while the
model answers the only question that matters, which is whether the field exists.

Why an interpreter can be wrong at all
--------------------------------------

The validated dependency set lives in `pellier/backend/.venv`. Shell entry points use
`$PYTHON` for exactly this reason, but any of these scripts can also be run by hand as
`python3 scripts/...`, and on an Amazon Linux box the ambient interpreter carries its own
older botocore. So the guard belongs in the script, not only in the caller.
