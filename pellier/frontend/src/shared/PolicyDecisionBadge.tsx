/**
 * PolicyDecisionBadge — a Cedar decision, rendered asymmetrically.
 *
 * The asymmetry is the point. ALLOW and DENY must differ by icon, by text,
 * and by accessible name — never by color alone. Two badges that differ
 * only in hue are unreadable to a colorblind attendee and invisible in a
 * grayscale conference projection, which is precisely where this workshop
 * gets demonstrated.
 *
 * The three states carry different claims:
 *
 *   ALLOW                 the policy permitted the action; execution is a
 *                         separate fact
 *   DENY                  the policy blocked it *before* execution, no tool ran
 *   WOULD_DENY            a real deny event under LOG_ONLY: observed, not
 *                         enforced, so the tool did run
 *   NOT_EVALUATED         no policy decision exists for this turn
 *   EVALUATION_INCOMPLETE the engine was asked and its answer could not be
 *                         read, which is not the same as no decision
 *   POLICY_INFERRED       a text scan of policy source matched; no engine
 *                         evaluated anything, so this is not a decision at all
 *
 * Neither absence state is styled as success or failure. Absence of a
 * decision is a real, honest state; coloring it green would claim a
 * permission nobody granted, and coloring an inference like a decision would
 * be worse: it would launder a substring match into governance evidence.
