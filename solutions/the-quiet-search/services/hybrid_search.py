"""
Hybrid Search Service — pgvector semantic branch (observe-only reference).

This file holds the pure pgvector cosine-similarity branch on its own.
Hybrid retrieval (vector + full-text + RRF) and Cohere Rerank are both
live in the application — see ``pellier/backend/services/hybrid_search.py``
and ``services/rerank.py``, plus the reranked reference in
``hybrid_search_with_rerank.py`` beside this file. Nothing was removed;
this copy deliberately excludes them so the semantic branch reads cleanly
next to the merged one.

The class name is retained (rather than renamed to ``VectorSearch``)
because ``HybridSearchService._vector_search`` is the canonical
pgvector reference called by the search tools and covered by
``tests/test_vector_search.py``. Renaming would ripple into the
solutions parity diff and recovery docs.

        Semantic vector similarity search using pgvector (retrieval reference).

        This is the core of semantic search — it finds products whose meaning
        is similar to the query, even when exact keywords don't match.

        The query follows Pellier's canonical pgvector pattern:
            - CTE: WITH query_embedding AS (SELECT %s::vector as emb)
            - Cosine distance operator: <=> (lower = more similar)
            - Similarity: 1 - (embedding <=> emb)  (higher = more similar)
            - HNSW tuning: SET LOCAL hnsw.ef_search = {int}  (per-query accuracy knob;
              Postgres disallows binds on utility statements — value coerced to int first)
            - Iterative scan: SET LOCAL hnsw.iterative_scan = 'strict_order'
              (pgvector 0.8.0+ — prevents overfiltering when WHERE clauses are strict)
            - In-stock filter: quantity > 0
            - Parameterized placeholders only — never f-string values into SQL.

        The method accepts a pre-computed embedding from the caller and does NOT
        call Bedrock Embed itself (Req 2.3.5).

        Args:
            embedding: Query embedding vector (1024 floats from Cohere Embed v4)
            limit: Maximum number of results
            ef_search: HNSW search parameter (higher = better recall, slower)
            iterative_scan: Enable pgvector 0.8.0+ iterative scanning (default: True)

        Returns:
            List of product dicts with similarity scores.
